> NOTE: Nothing is perfect! Read and check the commands thoroughly before you run them. Treat the AI generated commands as commands you find on the internet (because they are commands from the internet). Do not run a command you do not understand.

```powershell
PS> # List all git repositories in the current directory

2. Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>RightArrow</kbd> to invoke the AI completion

3. Check the output produced by the AI before you run it!
